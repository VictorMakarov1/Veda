# Veda - A Proof-Checking System

Veda is a new proof-checking system (a proof checker or a proof assistant) intended for checking mathematical texts (usally containing definitions and proofs)
written in the formal mathematical language V (see V.pdf in the current repo). It can useful, for instance, to students (self-)studying
a mathematical discipline. Currently these disciplines are elementary mathematical logic, elementary set theory and elements of group theory.
The student can write her own proofs and the system will check them for correctness. See the text file learn.v with proof examples in elementary mathematical logic
and set theory.
